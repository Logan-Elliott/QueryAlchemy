SQL Exploitation Toolkit For OSEP Exam

This is a custom SQL exploitation toolkit that joins together a number of programs I wrote during the PEN-300 course as well as a few unique options I created.

Big thanks to Offsec for supplying a lot of the code used in this program and for giving me a blue-print to build some of the unique options I incorporated in this program.

This code was written in less than one day and needs to be cleaned up and refactored.

Will create a to-do list and flesh out this readme file more in the future.
